Why this company?

I feel that my proven track record leading multi-functional teams makes me an excellent match for the job requirements. 
Also, the role excites me because I love the idea of helping to develop cutting-edge software products and I know I could start 
delivering results from Day 1.

Note:

Hi Alex, I have come across your posting and would love to connect and ask you to consider my profile as I am actively 
looking for new opportunities. I have recently been laid off from my intern due to the COVID-19 and considering my profile 
would really help me.
Thanks,
Saitejaswi Koppuravuri
